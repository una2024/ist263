        I like TED speeches because they are diverse, but whether the content is closely related to our lives or not, I am always interested in reading them. When the speaker expounds his own views through data and stories, he needs to resonate with the audience. The method is from "I" to "we". "I" is just the subjective feeling of the person concerned. Only from "I" to "we" can stimulate the empathy at the bottom of the audience's heart and gain recognition.<br><br>
        I learned that there is a web design for the information management of ischool College! I am very interested in UI/UX courses, so I chose this course!
